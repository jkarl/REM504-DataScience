# GitHub Practice

This is a folder where we can put some files to practice working with GitHub. Let's try the following:
1. Clone the class GitHub repository onto your computer
2. Create a Markdown file on your computer (put your name in the filename) in the GitHub_Practice directory
	a. A Markdown file is simply a text file with a .md extension. GitHub knows to render markdown files as stylized text on the web.
	b. Add some stuff to your markdown file to play around with the different styles (headings, bold, links).
3. Commit the change to your local repo
	a. Add a commit message
	b. This locks in the changes to the repo that is on your computer
4. Make a push request to send your changes up to the class repo on GitHub
	a. This may take a bit while we get everybody added as contributors to the class GitHub Repo.
5. Do a Fetch to download any new changes to the repo from GitHub
