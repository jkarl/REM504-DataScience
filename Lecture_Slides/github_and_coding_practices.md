### Learning objectives:
 - Understand version control and know basics of GitHub
 - Know when you should use a version control system
 - Understand basic coding best practices

## Version Control Systems
Version control systems (VCSs) tracks changes to files in a repository. Similar to common cloud-based file services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, a VCS monitors changes in files and allows for recovery of damaged or deleted files and for sharing of files with groups of people. However, a VCS differs from other cloud-based file services in several important ways:
1. a VCS is generally a manual process - i.e., you need to commit changes to a local repository and then push changes to a centrally-stored (e.g., cloud) repository.
2. a VCS gives finer control for rolling-back to prior versions of a file and has better features for handling multiple people working on the same file at the same time.
3. a VCS allows you to comment on the changes you commit.
4. a VCS allows for "forking" or creating alternative versions of files where you can experiment or add new features. If the fork works out, you can merge it back in to the main branch.

### Git vs GitHub
<img src="..\memes\xkcd_git.png" width=300><p>
Git is a VCS that was originally developed by Google, and is not the most commonly used VCS. Originally Git was a command-line program (and you can still run it that way). GitHub is a cloud web service that was set up to host repositories in a central and publicly-available way. You can use git to push directly to GitHub repos (like in the Bilschak et al. paper) or you can use the windows/menu-driven GitHub Desktop.

### Discussion of Bilschak et al. paper
 - Do the concepts of version control make sense?
 - Are you intimidated/put off by the command-line approach?
 - How would/could you use VCS in your research/work?

### Demonstration of GitHub Desktop
 - Clone class repository
 - Working with files in the repository
 - Committing changes
 - Pushing/pulling changes



### Markdown!!!
If you look around GitHub, you'll see that most repositories contain nicely-formatted descriptions and instructions. These are made using a special text file format called Markdown. Markdown files end in .md, and GitHub will recognize any file with that ending and present that file as formatted text. Markdown is great because it's syntax is pretty simple and easy to learn. It's good for creating readme files and how-to documents for your GitHub repos. We'll play with Markdown more throughout class, but for now, here's a link to the Markdown syntax: [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

### Basic GitHub Workflow
<img src="..\memes\in-case-of-fire-1-git-commit-2-git-push-3-leave-building2.png" width=250>
1. Make a pull from the master repository
2. Do what you do...
3. Commit your changes
4. Push your changes back to the master repository
