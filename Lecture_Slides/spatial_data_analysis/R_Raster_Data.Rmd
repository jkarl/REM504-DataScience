This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
## Set up our environment
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(rasterVis)
library(RColorBrewer)

data.path <- "C:/Users/jakal/OneDrive - University of Idaho/Documents/GitHub/REM504-DataScience/Practice_Datasets"
ps.file <- "PlanetScope_SR_2017-08-14.tif"
```
Loading raster data in R is _EASY_. You just issue the raster() function and give it the name of a raster file.

```{r}
# First, let's get some info about the raster layer
GDALinfo(file.path(data.path,ps.file))

ps.image <- raster(file.path(data.path,ps.file)) # This will bring in only the first band

ps.stack <- stack(file.path(data.path,ps.file))

```

Now let's explore this dataset a bit
```{r}
# Check extent and resolution
extent(ps.image)
res(ps.image)

# Check the coordinate system
crs(ps.image)

```

Let's look at these raster layers!
```{r}
# First plot the single band image

## Set up a grayscale color gradient
grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100,            # number of different color levels 
                                start = 0.0,    # how black (0) to go
                                end = 1.0,      # how white (1) to go
                                gamma = 2.2,    # correction between how a digital 
                                # camera sees the world and how human eyes see it
                                alpha = NULL) 

plot(ps.image, col=grayscale_colors)

## Now let's look at the multiband image
levelplot(ps.stack) # shows each band separately

plotRGB(ps.stack, r = 4, g = 3, b = 2, scale=10777) ## creates a RGB composite plot

```

## Raster operations
Working on raster data in R is also pretty easy. The big tricks are to make sure you have your data in the same coordinate system and that they all have consistent resolution.

```{r}

# Aggregate to a coarser resolution
ps.aggregate <- aggregate(ps.image,fact=8,fun=mean)
plot(ps.aggregate)

# Clip/crop/select
points <- readOGR(dsn=data.path, layer="IBPEpoints")

plot(ps.image)
points(points)

pts.extent <- extent(points)
ps.crop <- crop(ps.image,pts.extent)
plot(ps.crop)
points(points)

# extract values based on point locations
pt.values <- extract(ps.image,points)
pt.values

## extract based on raster values

# If you just want to create a mask with the values, then it's as easy as creating a logical statement.
ps.7kmask <- ps.image > 7000 
plot(ps.7kmask)

## If you want the actual raster values, then need an extra step to apply the mask
ps.extract <- mask(ps.image,ps.7kmask,maskvalue=T)
plot(ps.extract)

```


## Raster math
raster math is a general term for when you want to perform arithmetic operations on a cell-by-cell basis.
Raster math is what you'd use to calculate an index like NDVI from a satellite image.

```{r}
# Calculate NDVI from the planetScope image
ps.ndvi <- (ps.stack[[4]]-ps.stack[[3]])/(ps.stack[[4]]+ps.stack[[3]]) ## note the double-brackets for getting a specific band from the stack.
plot(ps.ndvi)

```

## Zonal statistics
Zonal statistics are calculated for distinct regions (zones) as defined by a polygon layer. In raster analysis this is super useful for calculating means, max, median, etc. for polygons. Let's calculate the average NDVI value for a buffer around each of the points. The zonal() function in R will do this, but your "zones" need to be defined as a raster first. Luckily, we can get the same answer with the extract() function in most cases.

```{r}
## Get the mean NDVI value for a 20m buffer around each point
ndvi.buffer <- extract(ps.ndvi, points,buffer=20,fun=mean)
ndvi.buffer

```
