# Individual Study Plan
## Courses *(with finish by date)*:
* Intermediate R (Feb 6)
* Cleaning data in R (Feb 20)
* Data Manipulation in R with dplyr (Mar 6)
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1) (Mar 20)
* Data visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2) (Apr 3)
* Writing functions in R (Apr 24)

I think I’m at a point where I’m familiar with all the basic functions and common packages of R but I still frequently copy and look up code from elsewhere. My hope is that these courses will help solidify my coding knowledge while helping me get to the next level. For example, I understand the basic data structures in R but I often struggle to remember how to effectively manipulate them with packages like *tidyverse* and I end up writing several lines of code when maybe 2 or 3 would suffice with *tidyverse* functions. I also want to improve my data visualization skills because this will be an important part of my dissertation project, as I find ways to better represent and communicate results to ranchers and land managers. In addition, I have found that I frequently do the same type of data manipulation across projects so I think it will be useful for me to learn how to write functions to save time, instead of writing the same chunks of code over and over again. Overall, these courses will help me on my journey to becoming a competent data scientist.
