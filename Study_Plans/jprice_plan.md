#Individual Study Plan
##Courses
1. Introduction to R (completed)
2. Intermediate R (February 15)
3. Data Visualization with ggplot2 part 1 (March 1)
4. Data Manipulation in R with dplyr (March 15)
5. Inference for Linear Regression (April 1)
6. Hierarchical and Mixed Effect Models (May 1)

I am not terribly good with R at the moment. Currently, I am using it primarily
for an applied regression course I am taking. For now, I just need a basic
understanding of how to use R to create figures and make inferences .
The hierarchical and mixed effects models course will hopefully help me
analyze some of the nested data for my grad project.

Going forward, however, I would like to also gain enough basic understanding
in R to recognize potential problems. The bulk of the code I have used to date
has been given to me. I have no idea what that code is meant for. Prior to this
course I would not have thought of that as a problem. Weeding out issues
probably entails a greater understanding of statistics in general, which I seem
to be incapable of. If someone knows how to become a stats guru without putting
in the time please let me know!
