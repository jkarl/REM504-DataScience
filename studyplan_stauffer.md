# DataCamp Study Plan
There are a few skills I'm interested in expanding: understanding SQL so that I don't need to rely on a GUI to build queries, learning to use Python the way I use R to expand my palette, more advanced or systematized data exploration approaches, statistical modeling, more formal approaches to spatial data, and best practices for efficient coding in R. It's a lot to approach, so I've listed them here in a loose order of priority with the thought that I'm unlikely to make it through all fourteen modules I identified in the course of the semester.
## General Outline
1) [SQL for data science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) - I'm frankly surprised I've made it this far with regularly using an Access database and only ever worked with SQL through a GUI.

2) Statistical modeling in R
    * [General](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-modeling-in-r-part-1) [courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-modeling-in-r-part-2) - Modeling seems more and more like something I want to dive into long term, so I ought to get a firm introduction to it.
    * [Regression](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/correlation-and-regression) - Specific, common techniques seem like a good idea to have under my belt!
    * [Forecasting](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-using-r) - Forecasting has less of a direct application to the kinds of work I've been involved in, which is more descriptive than predictive, but it sounds interesting.
    
3) [Advanced R for efficiency](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-efficient-r-code) - Working with ever larger data sets means that I need to actually start writing truly efficiently and potentially for parallel processing.

4) Exploratory analysis in R
    * [General theory](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis) and [case studies](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-case-study) - I have an intuitive grasp of and a repertoire of quick-to-implement skills for this after a few years of doing it, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are approaches or concepts I've missed and would benefit from.
    * ["Advanced" ggplot](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-part-3) - It feels sometimes like ggplot is infinite in scope and I want to know about the deep and powerful bits I've never even thought to look for.
    
5) Spatial data in R
    * [Analysis](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-r)
    * [Spatial statistics](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/spatial-statistics-in-r)
    
6) Python equivalents to broad R skills
    * [General Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)
    * [Data science-specific Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2)
    * [pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations)
    * [Cleaning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python)
